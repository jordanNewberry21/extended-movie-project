# React Extended Project - Movie Collection

> NOTE: Do not fork this repository. Instead, create your own repository from scratch.

As a capstone to your React fullstack work, you'll be building a larger project. To do this, you'll be flexing every code muscle you've built so far!

We've provided project requirements and a starter Trello board for you. There is no code provided, just the readme. You will be making everything from scratch. 


## Getting Started (Day 1)

1. Read Project Requirements
2. Create a repo (DO NOT CLONE/FORK)
3. Plan your tasks:
    - Copy the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/W1vv7aFe/movie-collection-weekend-project) to your own account. 
    - You should feel free to add, edit or remove tasks from your own copy, but do not alter the original.


## HELP! I'm Stuck

When you run into an issue, we ask that you try to work through it and figure it out. 

Steps:
1) Try Debugging (console logs or using a debugger tool), Reading Errors
2) Google a question
3) Ask a peer - remember to tell them:
    - What you are trying to do - high level summary
    - Show them relevant code 
    - What do you expect to happen & what is actually happening


## Features

#### Manage Genres View

### Database

Start with two tables **movies** & **genres**. When base features are complete, add more tables as needed for stretch goals.

## Stretch Goals

- Add Material UI for styling
- Ability to edit genres or movies
- Ability to search or filter by name or genre
- Vote up or down a movie
- Ability to favorite a movie and display favorites on a separate route
- Feel free to deviate from this list and add features of your own

## Variations

The following variations are available for this project. Instead of **movies**, you could implement the project with **books** or **songs**. Your database for base mode should still just be two tables.

- Movies -> Books & Genre -> Author
- Movies -> Songs & Genre -> Artist
